# Lab-6-Web-development
This lab focuses on styling a personal portfolio using core CSS concepts. Fonts, colors, spacing, and the box model were applied using class, ID, and descendant selectors. Layout techniques including float, clear, and modern alternatives were implemented. Browser DevTools were used to inspect the box model and resolve layout issues.
